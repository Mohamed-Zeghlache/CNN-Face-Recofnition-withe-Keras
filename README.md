building a CNN to recognize faces using Keras API and OpenCv


we presented the implementation of the face recognition approach based on convolutional neural networks, for which we used a smaller version of the VggNet architecture model and several experiments and presented different results obtained in terms of accuracy and error. The comparison of the results found has shown that the number of epochs, the size of the base and the learning rate, are important factors for obtaining better results.
    
The proposed approach for facial recognition works for low resolutions (the images are 96 x 96 in size), interesting for future extensions of the technique. The approach uses a particular architecture of the convolutional neural network. This projects a face in a space of smaller dimensions, where the actual recognition is performed. Tests on such a limited database are encouraging.
